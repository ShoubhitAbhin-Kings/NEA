old_sign_language_model is the old CNN model that is not very good
signlanguagemodel is the new model that is very good on A, C and E and mostly D
sign_language_model is the newer model (created 0402022 in the free period in the random room in the corridor that isn't really a room) that is very very good for A, and C
theModel is the newest model (created in period 5 of 0402022) - CURRENTLY THE DATA IN notAugmented and trainOnThese is the data that is being used for this model, the main difference being no augmented data for B and D to take into account their vertical nature. This will be moved to the dataFor040225 folder once the model has been generated

--- future things : data structures : trees
As a potential future enhancement, using a tree data structure can be explored to support the formation of cohesive words from individual gestures. A trie (prefix tree) could be employed here, where each node represents a letter or character, and paths form sequences of letters corresponding to valid words in the system’s vocabulary.

For example, each node in the tree could store a letter, and the traversal from root to leaf nodes would represent a series of recognized gestures, ultimately forming a word. This could be further optimized with the use of a search algorithm (such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS)) to traverse the tree and determine valid words or phrases as users sign.


       (root)
      /  |  \
     A   B   C  
    / \   \   \
   P   R   A   A
  /     \   \   \
 L       E   T   R
  \       \   \   \
  E       D   S   T


  i.e for the word APPLE you can go LLLR from the root
